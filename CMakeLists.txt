# Control where libraries and executables are placed during the build.
# With the following settings executables are placed in <the top level of the
# build tree>/bin and libraries/archives in <top level of the build tree>/lib.
# This is particularly useful to run ctests on libraries built on Windows
# machines: tests, which are executables, are placed in the same folders of
# dlls, which are treated as executables as well, so that they can properly
# find the libraries to run. This is a because of missing RPATH on Windows.

# Note that it is extremely important to use exactly the project name while installing configuration

# find_package() to properly look for the installed library in system path, in particular in Windows
# when the installation is performed in the default path.

# install_basic_package_files() comes with many input parameters to customize the configuration
# files. The parameters used in the following call provide basic versions of CMake configuration

# Note that if your library depends from other libraries, you are probably
# required to used the install_basic_package_files() DEPENDENCIES option.
